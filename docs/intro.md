**Welcome to the Equilibria Wiki!**

The Equilibria wiki is a collection of information regarding Equilibria. This wiki will be actively updated as Equilibria grows and progresses in development.

**Equilibria Summary**

Equilibria is an **open-source project** focused on creating a **private** and **decentralized** oracle solution for a multitude of use cases. We are prepared for two initial use cases â€“ digital asset price tracking and distributed match results for esports events.

Equilibria Oracle Nodes are community-run nodes that monitor data and relay it back to the blockchain. These nodes are economically bound to the network by staking **XEQ** to disincentivize dishonest nodes.
