# Equilibria premine

**Original Project Before June 2020 Comeback**
Based on a pre-launch community survey the Equilibria Team opted to include a small premine with the mainnet launch on 28 February, 2018. This premine of 3,000,000 coins was ~3.57% of the maximum mineable supply and has since been used to pay for contracted work, exchange listings, and miscellaneous expenses. The entire premine was sold off due to high expenses and XEQ now being very expensive. 1M XEQ was also given away to the community.

**New Pre-mine After Comeback**
The team opted for a new premine when they came back in June 2020. The total is 7M XEQ in order to pay for expenses during the early stages of the project. Some of the new premine is used for running oracle nodes to kickstart the Equilibria oracle network.
