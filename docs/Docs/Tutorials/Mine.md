# How to mine XEQ

Equilibria is a privacy cryptocurrency coin that utilizes Proof of Work (PoW) consensus to build and verify blocks on the blockchain. The mining algorithm used for Equilibria’s PoW model is CryptoNightGPU, a variant of the CryptoNight family that is targeted to be ASIC resistant, equally performant for the two main GPU manufacturers (AMD and NVIDIA) and to be egalitarian in how it scales performance across multiple generations of cards. As of right now the main mining softwares available are:
- AMD (Specific) Cards: ● SRB Miner ([Source](https://www.srbminer.com/))
- NVIDIA (Specific) Cards: ● CryptoDredge ([Source](https://cryptodredge.org/))
- AMD and NVIDIA Cards: ● XMR-Stak (and it’s variants) ([Source](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak))

### **Download xmr-stak miner**

Based on the brand of mining cards available, select the appropriate mining software and download it from the developers site. Be sure to set exclusions on virus protection/firewall programs as mining software are typically flagged as potential threats and will be automatically quarantined.

Once the files are available locally on the mining computer, set up the miner as per the directions of the mining software.

### **Choosing a mining pool or Setup a Node to mine**

To be able to connect to the Equilibria blockchain and provide mining power in the form of hashrate, the mining computer will need to be connected to an equilibria node and there are two options, a 3rd party mining pool or setting up and running a node locally. The first option is obviously the easiest option and a variety of active pools can be found between the two sites below.

Alternatively, an oracle node can be set up and the mining software pointed at the node to mine from. Refer to the instructions on how to set up an oracle node.
